# hello-world
Let's begin.

My first name is Clarice. My last name rhymes the sound a cat makes, in both English and Chinese.

I've been messing with html/css (+javascript, finally) ever since I was 13--back when all I knew was how to copy and paste bits of css into a "custom CSS" text area and hope that my profile had the cool feature its source promised to create. 

Since then, I've learned to style my own webpages to my own liking, integrating design principles and techniques to give them a higher-level design, focusing on clarity of content and clean aesthetics.

I tend to be a perfectionist, which is good for endeavoring to make high-quality work, but bad for pretty much everything else. 

It may be satisfying to see a vision achieved, but there are times when the satisfaction of a job well done (or close enough, according to those perfectionist standards) doesn't _quite_ seem worth the stress caused by trying to fulfill those expectations. 

Yet, conceding to do anything less seems equally stressful. 

It's quite the dilemma.
